# Gaussian Elimination
Concurrency Gaussian Elimination algorithm based on trace theory and implemented in C++. 
It works according to Foata's classes, which are described in the report.
Implementation is inside [src](https://github.com/xMOROx/Gaussian-Elimination/tree/main/src) directory.

## Theory and examples 
[Report](https://github.com/xMOROx/Gaussian-Elimination/blob/main/Gaussian_Elimination.pdf) (written in polish)

## Usage 
- Program to generate diekert graph [Generator](https://github.com/xMOROx/Gaussian-Elimination/blob/main/gauss_diekert.py)
- `Makefile` â€“ is used to run the program. By default, the program is run with the arguments `input.txt` and `output.txt`, which stand for the input and output file, respectively. Of course, it is possible to run the program with other file names (after compilation: `./main [input] [output]`).
